## *Abstract*

*The concept of using grammar rules as statements, which control the execution flow in a program, has been implemented and published as a theses in 1979 [^1] .*

*Grammlator is an advanced implementation of this concept. It takes a C# code file as input and evaluates special comment lines containing grammar rules. C# enum declarations specify the terminal symbols and C# method declarations are used as semantic methods. The formal parameters of these C# methods implement the strongly typed attributes of the terminal and nonterminal symbols. Conflicts produced by ambiguous grammars can be solved by static priorities or by C# functions (dynamic priorities evaluated at runtime of the generated code).*

*Grammlator generates well commented C# statements and method calls implementing the respective control flow. Special optimizations reduce the length of the generated code, improve readability and performance. The generated code is inserted in a specific region of the input file. Details of code generation are set by special directives in the source file.*

*This manual describes the user interface of grammlator, the syntax and semantics of the input files and the C# code generated by grammlator. Examples help to understand the concept and the manifold ways to use grammlator.*
