# GrammlatorExamples
A collection of examples demonstrating how to use grammlator

Grammlator is a preprocessor which reads C# program files, interpretes special comment lines
containing grammar rules, translates these to C# code and inserts this code into the source file.

A collection of class definitions (files) is used to demonstrate with small samples
how C# programs can be augmented with grammlator grammar rules e.g. explaining:
- grammlator lines
- grammlator comments
- grammar rules
- recursion
- C# methods defining semantic methods
- semantic attributes of terminal and nonterminal symbols and matching formal parameters of semantic methods
- solving grammar conflicts
- ...
